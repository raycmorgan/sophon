## Must do
* [] Deletion
    * [x] Node delete
    * [x] Btree delete
    * [] Node merges
* [] Large values (overflow pages or large pages)
    * [x] Heuristic for growing nodes
    * [] Shrink nodes (as part of delete / node merge algorithm)
* [] Range queries
* [] Duplicate keys
* [] Persistence
    * [] Logging / Checkpointing
    * [] Syncing pages


## Eventually
* [] Column store Nodes
* [] Multi-version

## Nice to haves
* [] Contention splits / xmerge
